# BrainF-ckPP

> Original BF-Interpreter made by [Camto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uNM73pfJn0), which I modified to make the BrainF*ck++ interpreter

#####Brain F*ck++ is a superset of the very small language, Brain F*ck. This
#####version has more features, (i.e. more commands) and it's all written in c++!

#How to run

If you're a Visual Studio enthusiast like me, just open up the .sln file and press ```F5```
